PHYSICAL LAYER (Layer 1)
    Where transmission of bits across the network occurs and includes physical and electrical network

    Transition Modulation: If the incoming signal changes during the clock cycle, then a 1 is represented, other a 0 is presented.
        the transition between voltages or the presence of light indicates a binary value
        Fiber is interpreted as on (1) or off (0)

    Layer 1 devices view networks from a physical topology

    Synchronization on this layer can be asynchronous or synchronous
        Asynchronous: Uses start and stop bits to indicate when transmission occurs
        Synchronous: Uses a reference clock to coordinate the transmissions by both sender and receiver

    Broadband vs Baseband: Broadband separates bandwidth into channels while baseband utilizes all available frequencies on a cable
    Baseband uses a reference clock to utilize synchronous communication
    Base = Single, Broad = Multiple

    Multi-Plexing: Multiplexing allows multiple people to use a baseband connection 
        - Time Division Multiplexing(TDM): Each session takes a turn, using time slots, to share the medium between all users
        - StatTDM: Dynamically allocates the time slots on a as needed basis 
        - Frequency Division Multiplexing: Divides the medium into channels based on frequency and each session is transmitted over a different 
        
    Layer 1 Device: Hub

Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
Package bits into frames to transmit over a network
MAC: Media Access Control (Logical) / Uses a 48-bit address which is hexadecimal
First 24bits = vendor code, last 24 = unique id 

    LAYER 2 VIEWS DEVICES LOGICALLY

    LOGIC LINK CONTROL 
        Provides connection services
        Allows acknowledgement of receipt of messages 
        Provides flow control
        Provides error control via checksum

Communication Synchronization:
    Isochronous - Uses a common reference clock and creates time slots for transmission of data
    Synchronous - Uses the same reference clock, will use beginning and ended frames to tell when to start and stop transmission
    Asynchronous - Uses individual reference clocks and uses start and stop bits, no control over when devices can communicate 

Types of operations: Switches, MAC Addresses, bridges

Section 4 - Network Layer
Forwards traffic with logical address, known as routing

	172.16.254.1 - IPv4 Address - Dotted Octet Notation

	Ways to route/forward traffic:
        Packet Switching:
            Data is divided into packets and forwarded
            MOST NETWORKS USE PACKET SWITCHING

        Circuit Switching: Dedicated communications link is established between two devices

        Message Switching: Data is divided into messages which can be stored and forwarded

Route Discovery & Selection (Decision of which path to take to send traffic):
    Routers use a routing table and can statically or dynamically find an IP using techniques such as: RIP, OSPF & EIGRP
    Routing protocols help us decide how traffic is gonna flow and how routers are gonna communicate information

	Connection Services (Augment L2 connection services to improve reliability):
        Implements flow control
        Packet reordering: Splits up large amounts of packets and sends them to a specific destination, putting the packets back together at the end. Each packet gets numbered and sequenced
        ICMP: Sends error messages and operational info to IP destination

	Devices for L3:
        Router
        Multi-layer switch (Works like a switch and a router combined), switches are always layer 2 unless it is multilayer 
        IPv4, IPv6
        ICMP

Layer 4 Transport Layer

    Dividing layer between the upper and lower OSI Stack

    Segments is the data type

    L4 Protocols: TCP & UDP
        TCP (Transmission control protocol): 
            Connection oriented protocol for reliable transport of Segments
            Seeks acknoledgment for reception of data
            SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK | Three way handshake | C -> S -> C -> S
            This allows to ensure all data is getting to the destination
            Types of Flags:
                SYN: Used to synchronize connection during three way handshake 
                ACK: Used to acknoledge successful receipt of packets
                FIN: Used to tear down the handshake 
                RST: Used when a client receives a packet that it was not expecting
                PSH: Used to ensure data is given priority
                URG: Labels a packet as urgent, proccess immediately
                    ---P-P--[PSH P P P URG]--P---P--- 
                Header Size: 20 Bytes

        UDP (User Datagram Protocol):
            Connectionless protocol that is unreliable way to transport segments
            UDP is for datagrams typically since its unreliable for segments
            If data is dropped sender is unaware
            Really good for audio/video data transfer
            If we used TCP for video and audio buffering would be insane
            Header Size: 8 Bytes

        TCP - Reliable, Connection Oriented, Segment retransmission and windowing flow control,
                segment sequencing & acknoledgment of segment reception

        UDP - Unreliable, Connectionless, no windowing or retransmission, no sequencing or acknoledgment

    Windowing:
        Allows the clients to adjust the amount of data in each segment
        Sends less data with increased retransmissions
        Opening and closing window to optimize bandwith

    Buffering:
        Occurs when devices allocate memory to store segments if bandwidth isn't available

    Layer 4 Devices: TCP, UDP, WAN Accelerators, Load Balancers & Firewalls

Layer 5 Session Layer

    Keeps conversations seperate to prevent intermingling of data

    Setup, Maintain, Tear down

    Setup: Check user creds and assign numbers to identify
    Maintain: Transfer data across a network, re-establish connection, receipt acknoledgment
    Tear down: Ending session after the transfer is done

    Layer 5 Devices:
        H.323 - Used to setup Maintain and tear downn voice and video connections (RTP - Real Time)
        NetBIOS - Used to share files over a network
##############################  End of Section 6  ####################################

##############################  Section 7  ####################################

Layer 6 - Presentation

Formats the data to be exchanged and secures the data with encryption

Key Presentation Layer Concepts:
    Data Formatting
    Encryption

Data formatting: Formatting data for compatability between devices
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) Ensures data is readable by the recieving system

Encryption is used to scramble the data to ensure its safe upon transfer
TLS (Transport Layer Security) is form of encryption on the 6th layer

Tech for layer 6th: Scripting Languages(HTML, JS), Standard Text, Pictures, Movie files & encryption
    These are all ways of representing data or "presenting" the data

Layer 7 Application Layer

Provides application level serivces where users communicate
    Types of applications: File Transfer, Network Transfer

Application Services: Unites communicating components from more than one network application
    Types of application services: Email(POP3, IMAP, IMTP, not gmail or outlook), remote access, file transfer, file sharing

Service Advisment: Sending out announcmentss to other devices on the network to offer services

Types of layer 7 operations: Email applications, web browsing, DNS, FTP, Remote access
    All low level operations

##############################  Section 9  ####################################

Encapsulation: The proccess of putting headers/trailers around some data

Each layer of the OSI stack assigns a specific header

PDU - Protocol Data Unit
    A PDU is simply a single unit of information transmitted in a network
    LN PDU is the terminology
    This unit is different depending on the layer its operating on (Bits, Frames, Packets, Datagrams/Segments)

Encapsulation goes down the stack while decapsulation moves up the stack

Payload - the data being sent / PDU

Ethernet minimum payload: 42 bytes using VLAN / 46 Bytes No VLANS

MTU (Maximum transmission unit): Maximum unit size when sending a payload
    If the payload size is larger than 1500, a jumbo frame is required
