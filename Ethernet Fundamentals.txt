############################  Ethernet Fundamentals  ####################################

Deterministic vs Contention Based:
    - Deterministic: Very organized and orderly, requires electronic token to transmit
    - Contention Based: Very chaotic and can transmit whenever possible
        - Causes collisions
        - Ethernet chose to use contention based networks 

    Carrier Sense Multiple Access w/ Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):
        - Prevents collisions by deferring transmission until no stations are transmitting
        - Carrier Sensing: Listen over the medium for data transmission
        - Upon Collision: Halt transmission and re-transmit after a random backoff timer

        Collision Domain: Each area of the network that shares a single segment
        Devices operate in half-duplex mode when connected to a hub
        Keep collision domains small in networks
        Ethernet Switch: Increases scalability of a network by creating multiple collision domains

Fiber Cable Standards:
    STANDARD | MODE | BANDWIDTH | DISTANCE
    - 100BASE-FX | MMF | 100 Mbps | 2km
    - 100BASE-SX | MMF | 100Mbps | 300m
    - 1000BASE-SX | MMF | 1000Mbps | 220-550m
    - 1000BASE-LX | SMF/MMF | 1000Mbps | 5km (SMF) or 550m (MMF)
    - 10GBASE-SR | MMF | 10Gbps | 400m
    - 10GBASE-LR | SMF | 10Gbps | 10km

    S = Short Distance & MMF 
    L = Long Distance & SMF ## BUT ## LX = SMF/MMF 
    F = Fast Ethernet over Fiber & MMF

Types of Hubs:
    - Passive: Repeat signal with no amplification
    - Active: Repeats signal with amplification
    - Smart: Active hub enhanced with SNMP (Simple Network Mgmt)

Collision Domains: Multiple network segments connected by hubs

Bridge: Analyzes source MAC addresses and makes smart forwarding choices based on the destination MAC
Switch (Multiport Bridge): L2 device that connects multiple network segments together
Router: L3 device that connects multiple networks and makes forwading decisions based on logical net info
L3 Switch: Makes L3 routing decisions and then interconnects entire networks, not just segments
