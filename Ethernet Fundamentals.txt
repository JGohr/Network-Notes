Deterministic vs Contention Based:
    - Deterministic: Very organized and orderly, requires electronic token to transmit
    - Contention Based: Very chaotic and can transmit whenever possible
        - Causes collisions
        - Ethernet chose to use contention based networks 

    Carrier Sense Multiple Access w/ Collision Detection (CSMA/CD):
        - Prevents collisions by deferring transmission until no stations are transmitting
        - Carrier Sensing: Listen over the medium for data transmission
        - Upon Collision: Halt transmission and re-transmit after a random backoff timer

        Collision Domain: Each area of the network that shares a single segment
        Devices operate in half-duplex mode when connected to a hub
        Keep collision domains small in networks
        Ethernet Switch: Increases scalability of a network by creating multiple collision domains
