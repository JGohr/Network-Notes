#############################  Copper Cabling  #################################
Copper Cabling:
    - RG-6 : Local cable companies
    - RG-59 : Used to transmit video like satellite tv

    Coaxial Cable Connectors: F-type (Cable TV and Cable Modems) / BNC(Used in older networks)

    Types of Copper Cables:
        Twinaxial Cable: Similar to coaxiial, but uses two conducters instead of a single copper line
            - Typically used for short range applications due to cost
        Serial Cable: Straight copper wires, DB-9 or DB-25
        Twisted Pair Cable: Ethernet
            - Less twists means more exposure to EMF which disrupts data flow
            - Higher CAT number means higher speed
            - UTP: Unshileded twisted pair, more common less expensive
            - STP: Shielded twisted pair, more expensive
            - Connector Types:
                -RJ45: 8 Pin connector, ethernet based networks
                -RJ11: 6 Pin connector, phone systems connecting to landline

    RJ = Registered Jack
    Used to carry voice or data which specifies the stadards a device uses to connect to a network

    Bandwidth: Theoretical measure of how much data could be transferred
    Throughput: Actual measure of how much data is succesfully transferred

    CAT Types:
    nBASE defines the speed of the cable
    BASE-T = Twisted Pair , BASE-TX = Twisted pair fast ethernet
        - CAT3: 10BASE-T | 10Mbps | 100m
        - CAT5: 100BASE-TX | 100Mbps | 100m
        - CAT5e: 1000BASE-T | 1000Mbps OR 1Gbps | 100m
        - CAT6: (1000BASE-T | 1Gbps | 100m) ### OR ### (10GBASE-T | 10Gbps | 55m)
        - CAT6a: 10GBASE-T | 10Gbps | 100m 
        - CAT7: 10GBASE-T | 10Gbps | 100m
        - CAT8: 40GBASE-T | 40Gbps | 30m

        Excpetions: 
            - Cat6 can operate at 10Gbps but the distance is shortened to 55m
            - Cat8 can operate at 30m due to speed
            - Cat8 will be the only bandwidth that is not just multiplied by 10

    Keep cable runs under 70m from the IDF (Intermediate Disutribution Frame) to the client 

    Straight Through Cables (Patch Cables): Contains exact same pinouts on both ends of the cable
    Crossover Cables: Swap the send and recieve order on one end
        Wiring Schemes:
            - 568A and 568B, B is preferred
            - Creating Cross Over:
                ST: SG G SO BL SBL O SB B
                CROSSOVER: SO O SG B SBL G SB B 
        DCE: Data communication equipment (Switch, modem, hub, bridge)
        DTE (Data Terminal Equipment): "Endpoint" devices (Desktop, Router, Server) that connect to DCE
        Straight Through can connect: DTE -> DCE & DCE -> DTE
        Crossover can connect: DTE -> DTE & DCE -> DCE
        Switch to a switch requires a crossover cable

        MDIX: Allows a straight through cable to be simulated as a crossover cable
        Assume for exam that switches don't support MDIX and a crossover cable must be used

    Plenum Cable: Coating used on outer layer of twisted pair cables that provides fire-retardant chemical layer
        Plenum cables are for ceilings, walls, raised floors etc. Non visible areas

#################################  Fiber Media  #####################################

Fiber Optic Cable: Uses light from a light emitting diode or laser to transmit data

Greater range and data capacity

Cons: Expensive, difficult to work with 

Categories: SMF (Single Mode Fiber) & MMF (Multimode Fibers)
    - SMF: Longer distances and smaller core size allows for only a single mode of travel for the signal
        - Core Size: 8.3-10u (Microns)
        - More expensive
        - yellow shieth 
    - MMF: Shorter distances and larger core size for multiple modes of travel for signal
        - Core Size: 50 -100u (Microns)
        - Used up to 2kms or less
        - blue shieth

Connector Types:
    - SC (Subscriber Connector / "Stick and Click")
        - Typically used for fiber connections in LAN enviornments
    - ST (Straight Tip / "Stick and Twist") 
    - LC (Lucent Connector / "Love Connector", side by side connectors)
    - MTRJ (Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack) 

Connector Contact Types:
    - APC (Angled Physical Contact)
        - Less Noise and stronger signal
        - Green connector
    - UPC (Ultra Physical Contact)
        - More noise, possible singnal loss
        - Blue
        - Suitable for enviorments that dont mind return loss (precision) like ethernet & LAN

Wavelength Divisional Multiplexing (WDM): Combining multiple fiber signals into one line

Types of Multiplexing:
    - CWDM (Coarse Wavelength Divisional Multiplexing)
        - 18 available channels
        - 20nm channel distance 
        - Ethernet: Up to 10Gbps / Fiber up to 16Gbps
    - DWDM (Dense Wavelength Divisional Multiplexing)
        - 80 Available channels
        - 0.8nm channel distance 
        - Up to 8Tbps (100Gbps / channel)

Transceivers: Conduct layer 1 to layer 1 conversions of media (Fiber to Copper)
    Communication Modes:
        - Bidirectional (Half Duplex): Devices need to take turns communicating
            - Ex: Walkie Talkies
        - Duplex (Full Duplex): Devices that can communicate at the same time
            - Ex: Cell phone 

    GBIC: Hot-pluggable gigabit ethernet transceiver that can take in copper or fiber

################################  Cable Distribution  #################################

Cable Distribution System: Organized system that connects the networks backbone in the MDF -> IDF

Demarcation Point: Where the ISP connection ends and your network begins

Main Distribution Frame (MDF): Telecom closet which serves as the main start for all interior cabling
Intermediate Disutribution Frame (IDF): Contains an edge switch and patch panel/etc to support nearby clients

Backbone Switch: Connects to everything else on the network, located in the MDF

Cable Tray: Structual system to securely support the cables and raceways

Punch Blocks:
    - 66 Block: Older analog/CAT3 systems that support 25-pair cabling 
    - 110 Block: High speed networks for CAT5+ cabling, uses insulation dispalacement connectors
    - Krone Block: European alternatie to a 110 block, only difference is the angle of the contacts
    - BIX Block: Another alternative uses various sizes of punchdown blocks

Patch Panel: Seperate plate to punch into the back from punchblock instead of tying directly into switch
    - Protects switch ports from wear and tear 

Fiber Distribution Panel: Fibers version of a patch panel which uses fibner connectors instead of punching

Toner Probe - Uses a metal tip to physically touch certain connections to test, also identifies the port
