**Function of multiplexing:** Multiplexing is a method used by networks to consolidate multiple signals -- digital or analog -- into a single composite signal that is transported over a common medium, such as a fiber optic cable or radio wave. 

When the composite signal reaches its destination, it is demultiplexed, and the individual signals are restored and made available for processing.
