### Definition of a router:
"A Router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.Â One or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks can be connected using a router. By sending data packets to their intended IP addresses, it manages traffic between different networks and permits several devices to share an Internet connection." - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-a-router/

Routers allow smaller local networks to travel across the beautiful creation we call the internet. Devices like switches, bridges & hubs allow for the interconnection of local area networks, routers on the other hand allow us to join these LANs together. They take the identification a step further using IP addresses.
