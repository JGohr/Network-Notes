**Function of a "Virtual Area Network"**:  Logically segment space on a single layer 2 device to allow for more flexibility.

VLANs are taking a physical L2 device and creating logical segments within that device for enhanced security, flexibility and broadcast domain isolation. In a large organization, you might have a VLAN for the finance department, another for the marketing department, and so on.
***
**Broadcast Isolation:** Devices within the same VLAN share a common broadcast domain, isolating broadcast traffic to that VLAN.
