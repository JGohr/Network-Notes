**Function of STP:** Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is a network protocol that ensures a loop-free topology for Ethernet networks. The primary purpose of STP is to prevent and eliminate loops in a network, which can cause broadcast storms and degrade network performance. STP works by identifying and blocking redundant paths in the network, creating a tree-like structure.

A network, such as the one listed below, could created a cyclical process of sending data. Network M could send a packet that could end all the way back to bridge 1 on it's right designated port.

STP allows assignment of Root, Designated & Blocked ports to allow flow control
