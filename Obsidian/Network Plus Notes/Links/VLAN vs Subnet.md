### Differences:
1. **Scope:**
    - Subnetting operates at the network layer (Layer 3) and involves dividing IP address space.
    - VLANs operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) and involve logical segmentation of a network.
2. **Traffic Isolation:**
    - Subnetting isolates traffic based on IP address ranges.
    - VLANs isolate traffic based on logical grouping, regardless of IP addresses.
3. **Flexibility:**
    - Subnetting is more rigid in terms of IP address allocation.
    - VLANs offer greater flexibility in grouping devices based on logical criteria.
4. **Implementation:**
    - Subnetting requires IP address planning and configuration at routers.
    - VLANs require configuration on switches, and routers may be used for inter-VLAN routing.

In summary, subnetting is primarily concerned with IP address allocation and network optimization, while VLANs focus on logical grouping and segmentation of devices for better network management and security. Often, both subnetting and VLANs are used together in large and complex network infrastructures to achieve the desired level of organization and control.
