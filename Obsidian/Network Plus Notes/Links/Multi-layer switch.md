### Definition of a multi-layer switch:
A multilayer switch (MLS) is a computer networking device that switches on OSI layer 2 like an ordinary network switch and provides extra functions on higher OSI layers.

Multi-layer switches combine the functionality of a regular switch with additional and improved routing capabilities of a regular router, typically over ethernet networks. The MLS uses hardware based routing which is significantly faster than traditional software based routing in standard routers
