**Function of a proxy server**: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a user's device and the internet.

When a user requests a resource or service, the request is first sent to the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the internet. The response from the internet is sent back to the proxy server, which, in turn, delivers it to the user.

#### Key Points:
1. **Anonymity:**
    - Proxy servers can enhance user anonymity by masking the user's IP address. When a user accesses the internet through a proxy server, the server's IP address is visible to the external world instead of the user's.
2. **Content Filtering:**
    - Proxy servers can be used to filter content, restricting access to specific websites or types of content based on organizational policies.
3. **Access Control:**
    - Organizations often use proxy servers to control and monitor internet access. Access policies can be enforced at the proxy server, preventing users from accessing unauthorized sites.
4. **Caching:**
    - Proxy servers can cache frequently accessed web content. This helps improve performance by serving cached content to users, reducing the load on the internet connection and speeding up access to frequently visited sites.
5. **Security:**
    - Proxy servers can provide an additional layer of security by inspecting and filtering incoming and outgoing traffic. They can block malicious content and protect against certain types of cyber threats.
