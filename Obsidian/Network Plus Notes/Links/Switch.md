### Definition of a switch: 
"A network switch is a hardware component responsible for relaying data from networks to the destination endpoint through packet switching, MAC address identification, and a multiport bridge system." - https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/networking/articles/what-is-network-switch/

Switches are essentially smarter, multiport bridges. They use identification of MAC addresses and a technique called packet switching to properly forward traffic to it's designated device, even if operating over a separate physical port. Switches transmit in full duplex mode, allowing numerous devices to send and receive data at the same time.
This device is still a OSI Layer 2 (Data Link) or TCP Layer 1 (Network Interface) device since it's handling MAC addresses and not IP datagrams
